# ExamCraft: AI-Powered Study Companion

## Overview

ExamCraft is an innovative AI-powered study companion designed to enhance exam preparation methods by analyzing past exam papers, generating personalized study materials, and delivering them to users via messaging platforms like WhatsApp. This README provides guidance on how to implement the project using various technologies, including Natural Language Processing (NLP) with spaCy and Hugging Face Transformers, and Machine Learning (ML) with Google GenerativeAI and Vertex AI.

## Technologies and Resources

### Machine Learning (ML)

- **Google GenerativeAI**: [Google GenerativeAI](https://cloud.google.com/generative-ai/docs)
- **Vertex AI**: [Vertex AI Documentation](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs)

### Messaging Platforms Integration

- **Twilio WhatsApp API**: [Twilio WhatsApp API Docs](https://www.twilio.com/docs/whatsapp)

## Implementation Steps

1. **Receive User Prompt**: Implement a Django web application (`views.py`) where users can input their study prompts.
2. **PDF Retrieval**: Within the Django application, retrieve the relevant PDF document containing exam information.
3. **AI Content Generation**: Utilize the `ai.py` script to generate study materials based on the user prompt and exam document using Google GenerativeAI.
4. **Twilio Integration**: Integrate with the Twilio WhatsApp API to send the generated study materials to users via WhatsApp messages.
