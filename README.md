# Problem Statement

## Challenges in Student Well-Being and Academic Success

Students today face a myriad of challenges that significantly impact their academic performance and overall well-being. The pressures of academic expectations, experiences of bullying, discrimination, and inadequate support systems contribute to these challenges. Traditional educational environments often fall short in addressing these issues comprehensively, leaving students vulnerable and unsupported. The lack of effective, integrated tools to help students navigate both their academic and emotional challenges can lead to adverse outcomes, including decreased academic performance, absenteeism, and severe mental health issues.

An alarming 9% of all teenage deaths are suicides, according to statistics released by the South African Depression and Anxiety Group (SADAG) in 2022. Worse still, one in five of South Africa's high school learners have attempted to take their own lives, with this figure continuing to climb. This underscores the urgent need for a solution that supports students both academically and emotionally, addressing these challenges in a holistic and accessible manner.
